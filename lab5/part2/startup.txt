early to bed and early to rise makes a person healthy wealthy and wise
actions speak louder than words
a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
fortune favors the bold
better late than never
never look a gift horse in the mouth
brevity is the soul of wit
dont count your chickens before they hatch
where there is a will there is a way
honesty is the best policy
