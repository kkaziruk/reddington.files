/* This program creates a simple ASCII graph where
 * negative values of y appear to the left of | (the vertical axis) and
 *  positive values appear to the right.

This makes it easy to see how the function behaves across different x-values. 

* The user starts by entering the start and end values of x, along with the step size, which determines how much x
 increases each time.
* The program then calculates y for each x, displaying the values in a table while also generating a visual graph.

The graph works by setting a central reference point (|) at column 50 and placing # symbols at positions corresponding to the 
y-values, shifting left or right based on whether y is negative or positive.

 Throughout the process, the program also keeps track of the highest and lowest y-values and displays them at the end.

 To verify correctness, the user can compare the printed numerical values with expected results, check whether the
 plotted points align properly, and observe if the max and min values make sense within the given range.
